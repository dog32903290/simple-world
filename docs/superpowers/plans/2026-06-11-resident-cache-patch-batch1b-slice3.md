# Resident Cache (Batch 1b first cut) + Incremental Patch (Slice 3 first cut) — Progress / Handoff

> **Status: ✅ DONE (two cuts, headless, additive).** 2026-06-11. Branch
> `codex/js-to-cpp-contract-migration`. This is a progress/handoff record (work already landed),
> not a to-run plan. Both cuts are headless, pure-CPU, NOT wired to production, NOT touching Metal.

**Goal of these two cuts:** make "resident" actually resident. Slice 1 flattens a nested
`SymbolLibrary` into a frame-stable `ResidentEvalGraph`; slice 2 cooks point buffers off it. But
the graph was rebuilt-able only by `buildEvalGraph` and re-evaluated from scratch every pull — so
the two reasons a resident graph exists over a per-frame-rebuilt one were both unfulfilled:

- **value not recomputed** (incremental evaluation / cache) → **batch 1b first cut**
- **structure not rebuilt** (incremental edit / patch) → **slice 3 first cut**

**Authority:** `external/tixl` @ SHA `395c4c55` (`docs/runtime/PARITY_TARGET.md` — do NOT pull).
**Blueprint (SSOT):** `specs/2026-06-10-compound-graph-design.md` — 承重決策 6 (version-chasing
dirty + per-output cache), 決策 7 (LIVE = always-dirty), 健檢二補 (patch version 規則組). The
slice ✅ notes there carry the canonical summary; this file is the longer handoff.

**Scope discipline:** the float **value graph only** (決策 6: 值圖 = eager 後序一趟, safe &
equivalent). Command/flow graph cache (pull-driven, Command-always) is deliberately untouched and
must not be contradicted (spec line 120 boundary). Engine `resident_eval_graph.*` (slice 1) and
production `cook` are zero-changed by both cuts.

## Cut 1 — Batch 1b: version-chasing dirty + per-output cache

**Files:** `app/src/runtime/resident_eval_cache.cpp` (+ decls in `resident_eval_graph.h`),
golden `resident_eval_cache_selftest.cpp`, `--selftest-residentcache`.

**Mechanism (TiXL `DirtyFlag` version-chasing, NOT content hash):**
- `ResidentOutputCache { baseVersion, sourceVersion, valueVersion, cachedFloat, isLiveSource }`
  lives ON the resident node, per output slot (C5; 拍板「節點 = slot」, not a parallel layer).
  `dirty == valueVersion != sourceVersion`. Initially dirty (valueVersion 0 != sourceVersion 1).
- **`baseVersion`** = the slot's OWN accumulated version (LIVE bump / edit-time push `++` this).
  Monotonic, never overwritten. **`sourceVersion = baseVersion + Σ upstream sourceVersions`**,
  recomputed each pull (multi-input combine = sum, so any input change dirties it). A leaf has
  upstreamSum 0 → sourceVersion = baseVersion. *(This base/sum split is the A4 fix — see Cut 2.
  The original was a pure `sourceVersion = upstreamSum` overwrite that erased a node's own version.)*
- `pullResidentFloat(g, path, slot, ctx)`: eager post-order, one pass. Recurses Connection inputs
  (always walks the cone — cheap), computes sourceVersion, recomputes + caches ONLY when dirty,
  else returns `cachedFloat` with no evaluate (the skip IS the win — 貴的靜態 op 算一次存著).
  An unresolvable upstream contributes a fixed version 1 (never 0 — D1 fix).
- `bumpLiveSources(g)`: `++baseVersion` for every `isLiveSource` slot, each frame (Trigger=Always,
  決策 7 / 🪤#1 per-frame invariant). `initResidentCache(g)`: per-output cache + isLiveSource
  (op declares always-dirty; slice scope = `Time`).

**Golden `--selftest-residentcache`** (all teeth): STATIC short-circuit (mutate an upstream const
WITHOUT a bump → stays cached 15, proving recompute is skipped), edit-push (bump → propagate sum →
27), LIVE per-frame (Time 14→35), dangling (orphaned upstream → computes 5, not frozen). `-bug`
skips `bumpLiveSources` → LIVE frozen at 14 (卡舊).

**Refuter (independent opus):** 5 SURVIVE (diamond / same-frame repeat pull / deep LIVE chain /
partial-dirty / sum-aliasing), 1 BROKEN+fixed:
- **D1** (`cecdaba`): a derived slot whose Connection upstream doesn't resolve summed to
  sourceVersion 0, colliding with initial valueVersion 0 → permanent false-clean (卡舊), even an
  edit-push couldn't rescue it. Broke TiXL's invariant (sourceVersion from 1, only ++, never 0).
  Fix: unresolvable upstream contributes fixed version 1.

**Commits:** `371e8ab` (feat) → `cecdaba` (D1 fix) → `badd58c` (spec). Mechanism later revised by
`5561e42` (A4, Cut 2).

## Cut 2 — Slice 3: incremental patch (the structural half)

**Files:** `app/src/runtime/resident_eval_patch.cpp` (+ decls in `resident_eval_graph.h`),
golden `resident_eval_patch_selftest.cpp`, `--selftest-residentpatch`.

**Two of the six S11 edits** (edit in place, preserve cache on untouched nodes, so patch == a
freshly rebuilt graph with the edit baked in):
- **`patchSetConstant`** (S1 value edit, `InputSlot.cs:57-63` / `ChangeInputValueCommand.cs:122`):
  set a Constant input's value, then `++baseVersion` on this node's outputs (edit-time push).
  Downstream goes dirty via the pull-time upstream sum; untouched siblings keep their cache.
- **`patchAddConnection`** (S11①, `Slot.cs:198-205`): rewire a Constant input to a Connection,
  then set `valueVersion = UINT64_MAX` sentinel (= TiXL `ValueVersion=-1`) to force a first-pull
  recompute. NOT a sourceVersion bump (would corrupt the derived sum — 健檢二補 ②).

**Golden `--selftest-residentpatch`** (all == rebuild): set-const (poison an untouched sibling's
const out-of-band, patch the other → 9×cached-3 = 27, NOT 9×99 — proves only the edited cone
recomputes), **derived-node value edit** (edit Multiply.b while Multiply.a is wired → 5×10 = 50),
add-connection (wire Time→Multiply.a → 7→35). `-bug` edits the constant skipping the patch's
invalidation → frozen at 15 (卡舊).

**Refuter (independent opus):** 6 SURVIVE (rewire / patch sequences / diamond / wrong-target /
multi-output over-invalidation / dangling-add), 1 BROKEN+fixed:
- **A4** (`5561e42`): `patchSetConstant` on a DERIVED node (one with a Connection input) was
  silently dropped — its `++sourceVersion` was destroyed at pull time by the `sourceVersion =
  upstreamSum` overwrite → stale value edit, patch != rebuild (15 vs 50). The golden missed it
  (it only edited a pure leaf). **Root cause in the 1b cache mechanism, not patch alone** — the
  overwrite discarded a node's own version contribution. Fix (root, not patch-local): split
  `baseVersion` (own, monotonic) from `sourceVersion = baseVersion + upstream sum`. Brings us
  closer to TiXL (SourceVersion is accumulated, never overwritten). This is why Cut 1's mechanism
  description above already reflects base/sum.

**Commits:** `b526e1f` (feat) → `5561e42` (A4 fix, also revises Cut 1's cache.cpp) → `415ce17` (spec).

---

## Verification (both cuts, at `5561e42`)
`--selftest-residentcache` PASS, `--selftest-residentpatch` PASS, both `-bug` variants FAIL (teeth).
Regression green: residenteval / residentcook / compoundmodel / graph / valuecook / pointgraph /
radialop. `check-arch` OK (all four new files are runtime leaves). File sizes healthy:
cache.cpp 118, patch.cpp 45, resident_eval_graph.h 150 (all < 400).

## Named-deferred (not silently dropped)
- **Slice 3 rest:** the other four S11 edits — disconnect (③ restore prior update action +
  ForceInvalidate, `Slot.cs:233-245`), add/remove child, change-definition-default (IsDefault
  filter, `Symbol.Child.cs:677-698`), IO change (orphan-connection cleanup); the full six-edit
  `patch == rebuild` golden; per-output precise invalidation (currently bumps ALL outputs);
  topological-order robustness for compound siblings.
- **1b rest (Command/flow layer):** Command-always (C2, `_valueIsCommand`), the four op primitives
  (trigger dirty-as-event / Loop re-eval / ForceInvalidate external push / stateful FxTime
  time-gate), diamond count-based selftest, one-pass == TiXL two-pass golden, TimeClip time-remap
  re-entry, automation-driven LIVE (S3 curve store), derived-and-LIVE.
- **Not started:** production swap + GPU buffer cross-frame cache (cookResident) = batch 2 / slice 4.

## Resume (next cut — pick one)
1. **Slice 3 rest** (recommended): finish the structural half — the other four S11 edits + the
   six-edit patch==rebuild golden. "Disconnect" brings in spec ③ (restore the pre-connection update
   action + ForceInvalidate), an un-touched load-bearing line. The patch machinery is hot and its
   version rules are refuter-verified for the first two edits.
2. **1b rest** — the Command/flow graph layer (pull-driven, Command-always, four primitives). Higher
   value once cookResident's cache lands, but the objects live in the GPU/stateful graph (harder to
   test headless).
3. **Slice 2b** — cmd/texture executor parity for cookResident + stateful op state on resident nodes
   (production-swap prep).

## Cut 3 — Slice 3 REST: the remaining S11 edits (2026-06-11, second session) ✅

**Files:** `resident_eval_patch.cpp` (+`patchRemoveConnection`), NEW `resident_eval_patch_lib.cpp`
(definition-level broadcast: `patchLibSetDefault` surgery w/ IsDefault filter;
`patchLibAddChild/RemoveChild/RemoveInputDef` = lib edit + `rebuildWithCacheMigration` — ONE
canonical wiring codepath, 3 migration rules incl. Connection-RESOLVABILITY as an input-diff),
golden `resident_eval_patch_lib_selftest.cpp`, `--selftest-residentlibpatch` (11 asserts, all
patch == rebuild + cache probes; `-bug` teeth).

**New invariant (generalizes D1/A4):** a slot's sourceVersion must NEVER DECREASE across an edit
*sequence* — disconnects ABSORB the dropped upstream contribution into baseVersion; migration
rule 2 uses the monotonic floor `max(baseVersion, sourceVersion)+1` AND mirrors it into the
sourceVersion field (the field only refreshes on pull — back-to-back edits with no pull between,
i.e. a batch-4 command group, read it stale).

**Refuter (independent, EXECUTABLE repros):** 8 survive, 4 BROKEN — all fixed, each repro now a
golden: A-1 stale-field regression (editSeqNoPull), A-2 stale kept-default under a wire
(keptDefault=27), A-3 set-constant dropped on wired slots vs TiXL SetTypedInputValue
(wiredStore=21), A-4 compound setDefault silent lib/g desync (compoundDefault=720).

**Named contract duty (now in code comments):** resident-level patches edit the PROJECTION only —
the command layer must pair the matching lib edit, or a later structural patchLib* discards it.

**Named-deferred:** per-output precise invalidation; compound-child AddChild (recursive inline);
isLiveSource OR-stickiness under future type-swap edits; per-edit surgical patch as a later
optimization over O(graph) migration (semantics are pinned by the goldens).

## Resume (next cut — pick one)
1. **1b rest** — Command/flow layer: Command-always (`_valueIsCommand`), the four op primitives
   (dirty-as-event / Loop re-eval / ForceInvalidate push / stateful FxTime gate), count-based
   diamond selftest split by type (value=1/pass, Command=per-pull).
2. **Slice 2b / production swap prep** — cmd/texture executor parity for cookResident + stateful
   op state on resident nodes; converge cook/cookResident (also pays the point_graph.cpp 477-line
   arch debt).
3. **Batch 2 存檔 v2** — symbols[] library + two-phase load + migration (schema per the spec's
   健檢修正 S15-S20 block).
